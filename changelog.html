    <ul>
        <li>Location guesses are out of screen when guessing for continents</li>
        <li>Artillerist skills images still don't exist (will defenitely add them)</li>
        <li>With the daily character/skill/location selection being completely random, having the same character/image/skill the next day ist not impossible to happen. Maybe i'll add some sort of cooldown to them</li>
        <li>Rowen, South Kurzan, South Vern, Voldis and Yudia are still missing some zones for location mode</li>
        <li>Currently players that haven't finished their quiz are in the ranking comparison with 0 points</li>
