        <p><strong>Important Legal Notice:</strong></p>
        <p>In Germany, it is legally required for website owners to provide their full contact details, including personal information, on their site.</p>
        <p>I'd rather not completely doxx myself, but unfortunately this is a legal obligation for anyone hosting a website while under german law (time to move countries).</p>
        <p>To all streamers: I would apreciate if you don't open the Impressum page during streams. It is intended only for legal purposes, and its contents will be in German.</p>
